# Sunderlab tutorials

This is a (now archived) repository holding a few brief tutorials on statistics and data visualization topics that I previously made for members of the (Sunderland Biogeochemistry of Global Contaminants lab group)[https://sunderlandlab.org/] at Harvard. (These were part of a series of tutorials by several lab members, so there are a few references here and there to other files that are not provided here.)

All tutorials use R or R Markdown. Tutorials include:

- **tutorial_11272023**: interactive mapping with R Markdown
- **tutorial_12042023**: basics of making summary tables and uses of non-parametric and parametric testing
- **tutorial_04052024**: basics of "clustering" in statistics 
- **tutorial_04122024**: basics of statistical power, including the use of simulations to conduct power analyses
